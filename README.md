Reboard
=======

Reboard is a keyboard remapping Firefox extension. It is intended to allow you to remap keys for playing HTML5 games.

Reboard is not designed to remap keyboard shortcuts.

Reboard simulates certain keyboard related events, but it cannot simulate actually typing text into a textbox or input box.
